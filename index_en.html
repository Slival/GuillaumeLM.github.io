					CGI was my first internship in the field of programming. I worked there mostly in COBOL and learnt JCL on the fly in order to work on routine programs for the National Bank of Canada. <br>
					It was a very interesting experience to adapt to older technology in order to maintain an equally old code base.

					I worked with a complex backlog system to manage needs of around 800 employees on the Eleonore mining site belonging to Newmont (Goldcorp, at the time). <br>
					I had to work in a team of about 5 people working closely together and had to constantly adapt to new, unique requests by the users. <br>
					These tasks ranged from simple ones such as configuring printers on the mine's network and reformatting of unused computers, to more complex ones such as assisting users throughout a site-wide account migration.

				  Feature Hunter is my most recent creation, made during the UQAC's autumn Wonderjam of 2022.
				  I worked on several diverse systems for this game: all player inputs were implemented and handled by code I made, I played a good part in implementing the weapon system along with some of the animations related to it, made several menus and the game manager which interacted with both said menus and level transitions.
				  I also worked on numerous bugs which either myself or others in the team encountered during the project.

				Potent Rodent is the game that my team and I made during the Ubisoft Game Lab Competition of 2021. <br>
				It's an online, cooperative game based on the magnetic attraction and repulsion between two players. <br>
				This needed a LOT of time due to the massive endeavour that the online replication of these magnetic forces turned out to be, but I'm quite proud of the final project in the end. <br>
				I'm also very proud of the help I gave with the game's general level design, despite it not being my main role in the team.

				My most recent game jam, Pachinko mountain is a physics-based party game where 1-4 players must climb up through levels and go past various obstacles in order to be the first to reach the top, with the help of their grapples. <br>
				I mostly used Unity's somewhat new movement system to handle the player's movements, along with the grapple's effect on the player. <br>
				The player character works through a state machine handling what state it can be left in, and I also did a lot of various, small tweaks and helped with sound integration and level design on half of the levels.

				Knock-Knock is an horror/survival game where two players must survive a night in a house with a roaming monster and limitted ressources.
				I've contributed to the game's lighting and implemented most systems that change according to the time passed. <br>
				I also did a lot of work on the monster's AI, which works with the help of a basic state machine which I'm quite happy with, save for a few small problems in it.<br>
				Due to poor management and planning regarding who does what on the team, the game is in a rather buggy state, sadly, though it is still playable at the very least.

					This was my first experience working in a group in order to create a serious video game. <br>
					The game was made to raise awareness towards the dangers of poor hygiene and even simply their presence in a crowded environment during a viral outbreak. <br>
					This is done by placing the player in a shopping mall and tasking them to collect items throug it, then giving them a detailed recap as to what, and who ultimately got infected by the present virus and what portion of those effects were due to the player. <br>
					I personally mostly worked on the various infection mechanisms, between npcs, the player, and other points of interests. I also did some work on player movement and bindings for interractions.
