Requirements:
 Passion for performance, precision.
		

2K info:
Made Civilization, Borderlands, XCOM and Bioshock.

Perks:
I've had a class titled Computer animation and images in which I learnt to animate using WebGL and shaders in web pages and Unity. That's a bit fuzzy in my memory right now, but I've kept all documents so I'm certain it'd come back to me real quick if those technologies can be useful for this position.
I've also had a Python class in which I used machine learning to find trends in a massive amount of data.


Apps:
Autodesk Maya: 3D Model & Animation software. I can ask my boyfriend for info on this, or take a course.
Vicon Shogun: Motion capture software.


Questions:
I couldn't find the studio I'd be working at. I know it's 2K Mocap at Montréal, but I really just couldn't find much information about that team and I'm pretty curious to know where it is more precisely.

How big would the team I'd be working with be?

Additionnal responsibilities are mentionned in the document, could I get some more examples of these?

Could I get more precisions as to how we could possibly make remote work, or hybrid work depending on what is prefered, work?


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tell me about yourself  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Well, since I'm applying for a job here, I'll start off with information that's more relevant to that. I've been goin through two courses, for my Bachelor's, and for my College Diploma, that were very, very diverse.

I've learnt over ten different programming languages, worked with a lot of diverse tools for several fields, which include a few ones more so on the side of art than programming.

So I'm certain that what will help me shine here is mostly my ability to learn, combined with the bases I have in quite a lot of things already, which will help me kick off that learning process.

I have a few passions that match pretty well with the job listing, most importantly storytelling and art in general.

Regarding past experiences, I've also worked several times in small development teams, whether it be for game jams or more official endeavours, and I've also had several classes on project management,
so I'm going to be able to follow release cycles and the likes.

So despite the fact I don't have much of a handle on the tools mentionned such as Autodesk Maya and Vicon Shogun, I'd be happy to learn more about them both for personal growth and, obviously, to be a better fit.

Regarding my personality, well, I consider myself to be very patient, polite, professionnal, and somewhat of a perfectionist when it comes to things I produce.

I'm not trying to say I'm the best, of course, but I put my all into doing the best I can so that I can be proud of myself in the end.

On a more personal level, I'm an open minded person that likes trying new things. I've lived a year, as a child, in Tanzania, and almost five years in New Caledonia later on in my life.

My main hobbies are mostly tech-based: I like playing games such as Darkest Dungeon and Civilization to name two of my favorites, and I like listening to music online a lot.

I also dabble in 2D art, and even though I'm nowhere near what most would consider good yet, it's pretty much been a dream of mine for a few years now to be able to draw well eventually, especially since I got myself a graphic tablet recently.

Oh! I'm also in a relationship with Julien, who is the one who refered me to this position, and we'd both like to travel some day, maybe move somewhere, maybe just see more of the world, we're not too sure yet but we'll see as things evolve.
That's... About it~

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Personnal stuff  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fav Games	 -	(Roguelike) Binding of Isaac / Darkest Dungeon
				(Survival Platformer) Rain World
				(Turn based strategy) Civilization / Stellaris
				(Jeu de plateau) Colon de Catan / Magic the Gathering

Weakness	-	I tend to, well, overanalyze things when I'm not used to them.
I've got a preference for well defined plans before going into something, whether that's my own or someone else's, and that can cost a bit of time as a result.

Positive	-	A lot of people around me think I'm pretty empathic. I listen well to others and try my best to help them, and know how to put myself in their shoes.
 
My most proud moment - Ubisoft Game Lab 2021, won "Best Artistic Direction and Production"

A moment that defined me - My game dev class at the very end of college
Un moment qui m'a défini - Monc ours de programmation de jeu vidéo, à la toute fin de mon Cégep.
